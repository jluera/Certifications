# Certifications
Certifications and other tech related statemenets of achievement I have received.

There is a folder for expired certificates so I can track those over the years as well.

Note: My Google Cloud Certified Professional Data Engineer certificate expired on June 3, 2023.  
I am currently preparing to take the re-certification exam and I expect to complete it by the end of June 2023.
